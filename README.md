This repository contains two R scripts: dots-on-a-map.r creates a .png map based on SYR data dots-by-zip.r also creates a .png map, but requires an input file with a zip code column in it

Also included are two configuration files (*_cfg.csv) for the two scripts. There is also a .csv containing the latitude and longitude of every USA zip code. As a bonus, a shapefile from census.gov is provided to draw USA maps.

This effort is provided in a playful spirit, so have fun with them.
